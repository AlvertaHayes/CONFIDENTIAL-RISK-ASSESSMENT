CONFIDENTIAL RISK ASSESSMENT - ONE MINUTE SCRIPT

---OPENING---

Today, we're introducing Confidential Risk Assessment: a privacy-preserving financial evaluation platform powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

---PROBLEM---

Financial institutions need to assess applicants for credit, loans, and investments. But traditional systems require accessing sensitive personal data. This creates privacy risks and regulatory compliance challenges.

---SOLUTION---

With FHEVM, applicants submit encrypted financial information: credit scores, income, employment history, and debt ratios. The system evaluates everything while data remains encrypted throughout the entire process.

---KEY FEATURES---

First: Encryption at Submission - All data is encrypted before leaving the user's wallet.

Second: Encrypted Evaluation - The contract performs computations on encrypted values without decrypting them.

Third: Secure Decryption - Results are only decrypted through an oracle callback with cryptographic verification.

Fourth: Access Control - Explicit permission management ensures only authorized entities access encrypted data.

---USE CASES---

This enables compliance-friendly credit scoring, anonymous loan applications, and decentralized risk pools where privacy is guaranteed.

---TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS---

The implementation demonstrates core FHEVM concepts: encrypted data types like euint16 and euint32, proper access control patterns, time-based restrictions, batch processing, and oracle integration for decryption callbacks.

---CLOSING---

All code is production-ready with over fifty comprehensive tests, automated documentation generation, and scaffolding tools for creating new FHEVM examples.

Financial privacy is no longer a trade-off. It's the standard.
